# Problem Definition
The NBA is the pinnacle of basketball, bringing together the best talent from around the world. It is also notorious for being very player-stats-driven, which often influences the decision-making of coaching and teams. Our goal is to analyze data for players, coaches, and organizations within the NBA to get a data-driven understanding of how all of these actors interact. For the scope of this project, we’ll look at what drives the financial performance of organizations, as well as how player and team performance has affected wins/losses throughout the history of the league.

Each actor within the NBA will be able to realize value from this analysis. A better understanding of how each actor interacts with each other can help opponents strategize for upcoming games, guide organizations to make data-driven financial decisions, or influence decision-making in sports betting.

# Executive Summary
The comprehensive analysis of NBA player performance, team dynamics, and financial trends reveals several key insights. Kevin Durant stands out as the scoring leader, emphasizing the dominance of top-tier players in the current era. LeBron James, despite lacking formal collegiate education, emerges as the highest-paid player. The correlation between top contributors and high scorers underscores the significance of offensive prowess over assists. Defensive prowess is exemplified by DeAndre Jordan, while successful coaching performances by legends like Steve Kerr and Phil Jackson are highlighted. Team-wise, the Los Angeles Lakers demonstrate consistent excellence, while fan engagement, reflected in attendance, is notably strong for teams like the Chicago Bulls. The timing of games at 8:00 pm correlates with higher scores, indicating more exciting matchups. Additionally, the analysis sheds light on the evolving landscape of player salaries over the years, reflecting the impact of inflation.

# Introduction, Motivation, and Importance of the Project
Embarking on a data analysis project focused on the NBA is fueled by the vast and intricate web of information surrounding players, coaches, and organizations within the league. The motivation behind delving into this trove of data lies in the profound impact it can have across various domains. By unraveling the interplay between players, coaches, and organizations, a clearer understanding emerges, enabling opponents to craft strategic game plans that cater to specific strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, this wealth of information can serve as a compass for organizations, steering them toward data-driven financial decisions that optimize player acquisitions, contract negotiations, and overall team management. Beyond the court, the insights derived from data analysis can also play a pivotal role in the realm of sports betting, providing enthusiasts with a well-informed basis for decision-making. In essence, the motivation behind this NBA data analysis project lies in its potential to revolutionize how we perceive, strategize, and engage with the dynamic world of professional basketball.

# Key Findings and Conclusion
If we take a step back and look at the queries in the EDA section, we managed to better understand players, teams, and financials.


**Business Value of player queries:**
The player queries can be utilized by opposing teams and front offices. For example, the top defensive players query can help coaches plan their matchups ahead of time so that the team will be able to make the proper adjustments when they have to play that team with the specific player. For a front office or media use case example, the players with the top per game stats query can be utilized to schedule primetime game slots.

**Business Value of Team queries:**
The team queries can be utilized by the teams and front offices themselves, and the NBA as an organization. For example, a top 5 team in average attendance like the Knicks might want to use this information to continue utilizing their current marketing strategies or pricing in order to maintain that metric.

**Business Value of Financial queries:**
The Financial queries are very useful for front office operations. The information provided by these can help make data-driven financial decsions. For example, the relative per game stats and relative salary query allows front offices to see what players are underperforming or overperforming based on their current salary. It's a great way to narrow down what players you are looking at in the trade window or in the free agency.

**Dashboard Value**
Considering the capabilities of the dashboard, we have already mentioned that there is use on the Player, Team and Organizaitonal level. Though the dashboard only reaches 2019 (due to the limitations of the data), it serves as an excellent proof of concept to be utilized on current and future data. This will allow data informed decision making at all levels of the NBA.
